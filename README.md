## 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to the **Python Discord Bot**! This bot features modular category-based commands (Cogs), automated welcome & goodbye embeds, an interactive setup wizard for buttons/tickets (using persistent views), and a full-featured simulation economy.

> [!NOTE]  
> All configurations, server settings, logs, and balances are stored locally in a simplified, lightweight JSON file (`database.json`).

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **⚙️ Configurable Prefix**: The bot prefix is completely dynamic and controlled directly through the `.env` file.
*   **📁 Category Subfolders**: Clean directory layout (`commands/utility/`, `commands/moderation/`, `commands/config/`, and `commands/economy/`).
*   **📩 Advanced Ticket System**: Deploy interactive support panels with custom embeds and persistent buttons using `!setupticket` (survives restarts!).
*   **💰 Rich Economy System**: Earn coins, bank money, transfer funds to peers, and perform cash robberies!
*   **👋 Welcome & Goodbye**: Greet new members and track leaving users with visual embeds containing live counters.
